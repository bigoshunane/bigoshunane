### Hi there üëã I am Shunane

Multidisciplinary systems and materials engineer & data analyst with passion for materials for energy and data analytics. Possess a foundational knowledge of stimuli responsive materials needed to evaluate their structure activity relationships through novel materials characterization techniques such as SEM, XRD & FTIR. Moreover, skilled in Python, JavaScript, Tableau, Power BI, Apache Hadoop & PySpark, and both SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Strengths; adept at working independently and collaborating with teams across multiple functions to take information from a wide variety of sources and effectively breakdown concepts in layman terms to diverse audiences.
With each project, my aim is to learn new skills and to make the most energy efficient product in any product development projects. I am excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced quality-driven team to build better future & experiences for the users who will come across my works.
